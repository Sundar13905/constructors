# Constructors and Destructors 

# Experiment 12 To study and implement Constructors and Destructors

## Aim: -
To run and execute a code in C++ using Constructors and Destructors

## Theory: - 
A constructor in C++ is a special member function of a class that is automatically invoked when an object of that class is created.
The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's data members and to perform any setup or allocation required for the object to be in a valid state.

### Key Characteristics of Constructors:
1. Same Name as Class: A constructor has the same name as the class in which it is defined.
2. No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
3. Automatic Invocation: Constructors are called automatically when an object is created. The programmer does not need to explicitly invoke them.
4. Overloading: Constructors can be overloaded, meaning a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters.


### Types of constructors 

1. A __default constructor__ is a constructor that takes no arguments and initializes objects with default values. If no constructor is provided in a class, C++ automatically generates a default constructor.

2. A __parameterized constructor__ takes one or more arguments, allowing objects to be initialized with specific values. These constructors can be overloaded, providing multiple ways to create an object with different initializations.

3. A __copy constructor__ is a special constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object by taking a reference to another object of the same class. If not explicitly defined, C++ provides a default copy constructor.

4. A __move constructor__ transfers resources from a temporary object (rvalue) to a new object, preventing unnecessary deep copies and enhancing performance, particularly with dynamic memory or large objects.

### Advantages of default constructor :
1. Automatic Initialization: It automatically initializes object members to default values, ensuring that the object is in a valid state.
2. Ease of Use: Simplifies object creation when no specific initialization is needed.
3. No Arguments Required: Objects can be created without providing any arguments.

### Disadvantages of default constructor :
1. Limited Flexibility: It doesn't allow initialization of objects with specific values. All objects are initialized with the same default values.
2. Unintended Default Values: The default values may not always be meaningful or appropriate for the intended use of the object.

### Advantages of parameterized constructor :

1. Custom Initialization: Allows the creation of objects with specific initial values, providing greater control over object state.
2. Flexibility: Supports overloading, enabling multiple parameterized constructors with different sets of parameters.
3. Explicit Initialization: Ensures that important data members are set to meaningful values at the time of object creation.

### Disadvantages of parsametrized constructor :

1. No Default Construction: If only parameterized constructors are defined, objects can't be created without passing arguments, which can lead to inflexibility.
2. Increased Complexity: Overloading with multiple parameterized constructors can make the class more complex and harder to manage.

### Constructor Defined Outside the Class
### Advantages:

1. Clear Separation: Separating the declaration and definition of the constructor can make the class definition cleaner and more readable.
2. Code Organization: Helps in organizing large classes by separating implementation details from the class interface.
3. Reusability: Allows constructors to be reused across different classes in the form of common helper functions or utilities.

### Disadvantages:

1. Code Fragmentation: The class definition and constructor implementation are in different places, which can make the code harder to follow, especially in large projects.
2. Maintenance Overhead: Maintaining and debugging the code can be slightly more difficult as the constructor's implementation is separated from the class.

### Copy Constructor
### Advantages:

1.Object Duplication: Enables the creation of a new object as an exact copy of an existing object, which is essential for managing resources like dynamic memory, file handles, etc.
2. Deep Copy: Custom copy constructors can be implemented to perform a deep copy, avoiding issues like double deletion when dealing with pointers.
3. Consistency: Ensures that all data members of the object are copied correctly, preserving the object's state.

### Disadvantages:

1. Performance Overhead: Copying large objects can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially if deep copies are involved.
2. Unintended Copies: Unintended use of the copy constructor (e.g., passing objects by value) can lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.
3. Complexity: Implementing a custom copy constructor, especially for classes managing resources, can be complex and error-prone. If not implemented correctly, it can lead to issues like memory leaks or shallow copies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Destructors 

### Application of destructors 
1. **Resource Management:** Frees resources like memory or connections when an object is destroyed.

2. **Memory Cleanup:** Prevents memory leaks by deallocating memory used by the object.

3. **Closing Files/Connections:** Ensures files or network connections are properly closed.

4. **Releasing Locks:** Releases synchronization locks to prevent deadlocks.

5. **Logging and Debugging:** Logs object destruction for debugging purposes.

6. **Custom Cleanup:** Handles specific cleanup tasks required by the object.

### Advantages of Destructors:

1. **Automatic Resource Management:** Ensures resources are released automatically when objects are destroyed, reducing the risk of resource leaks.
  
2. **Simplifies Code:** Eliminates the need for manual cleanup, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.

3. **Error Prevention:** Reduces the likelihood of errors like memory leaks and dangling pointers by ensuring proper resource deallocation.

4. **Consistent Cleanup:** Guarantees that cleanup tasks are performed consistently, even in the presence of exceptions or errors.

5. **Encapsulation:** Keeps resource management encapsulated within the object, adhering to the principles of object-oriented programming.

### Disadvantages of Destructors:

1. **Hidden Costs:** Destructors can introduce hidden performance costs, especially if complex cleanup tasks are involved.

2. **Uncontrolled Timing:** In some languages (e.g., Python), the timing of destructor calls is not guaranteed, which can lead to unpredictable resource management.

3. **Order of Destruction:** Destructors might be called in an order that could cause issues, especially with dependencies between objects.

4. **Circular References:** In languages with reference counting (e.g., Python), circular references can prevent destructors from being called, leading to resource leaks.

5. **Complex Debugging:** Errors in destructors can be difficult to debug, especially if they are related to resource management.

| **Purpose**          | Initializes an object.                             | Cleans up an object.                             |
| **Syntax**           | Same name as the class, no return type.            | Same name as the class, preceded by `~`, no return type. |
| **Invocation**       | Called when an object is created.                  | Called when an object is destroyed.              |

| **Execution Order**  | Executed first when the object is created.         | Executed last when the object is destroyed.      |
| **Parameters**       | Can take parameters.                               | Cannot take parameters.                          |

# Experiment 13 To study and implement Constructor Overloading

## Aim
To write a code using constructor overloading

## Theory
### Characteristics of constructor overloading: 
Sure, here is the definition of **Constructor Overloading** broken down into points:

1. **Multiple Constructors:** Constructor overloading allows a class to have more than one constructor, each with a different set of parameters.

2. **Different Parameter Lists:** The constructors must have different parameter lists, which can vary by the number, type, or order of parameters.

3. **Automatic Selection:** When an object is instantiated, the compiler automatically selects the appropriate constructor based on the arguments provided.

4. **Flexible Initialization:** Overloaded constructors allow for different ways to initialize an object, depending on the data available at the time of creation.

5. **Same Name:** All overloaded constructors must share the same name as the class, just like any other constructor.

6. **No Return Type:** Like all constructors, overloaded constructors do not have a return type. 

7. **Enhanced Versatility:** Constructor overloading makes the class more versatile, allowing for more flexible object creation.

### Advantages of Constructor Overloading in C++:
1. Flexibility: Allows the class to be instantiated in multiple ways, depending on the available data.

2. Ease of Use: Users can initialize objects with different sets of data conveniently.

3. Improved Readability: Makes the code more readable by clearly defining how objects can be created.


### Rules for Constructor Overloading in C++:

1. Different Signatures: Each overloaded constructor must have a different signature (i.e., a different set of parameters).

2. No Return Type: Like all constructors, overloaded constructors do not have a return type, not even void.

3. Same Name: All constructors must have the same name as the class name.

### How Constructor Overloading Works in C++:

1. When an object is created, the C++ compiler checks the arguments provided and chooses the constructor that matches the argument list.

2. If no arguments are passed, the default constructor is called.

3. If arguments are passed, the constructor with the matching parameters is called.

## Code 
~~~
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box {
private:
    double width, height, depth;

public:
    // Default constructor
    Box() {
        width = height = depth = 0;

    }

    // Constructor with one parameter
    Box(double side) {
        width = height = depth = side;
        
    }

    // Constructor with three parameters
    Box(double w, double h, double d) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
        depth = d;
        
    }

    void showVolume() {
        cout << "Volume: " << (width * height * depth) << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box box1; // Calls the default constructor
    cout<<"Enter the side of the box: "<<endl;
    int side;
    cin>>side;
    Box box2(side); // Calls the constructor with one parameter
    int wd,ht,dep;
    cout<<"Enter the 3 sides of the box: "<<endl;
    cin>>wd>>ht>>dep;
    Box box3(wd,ht,dep); // Calls the constructor with three parameters

    cout << "Default constructor called!" << endl;
    box1.showVolume();
    cout << "Constructor with one parameter called!" << endl;
    box2.showVolume();
    cout << "Constructor with three parameters called!" << endl;
    box3.showVolume();

    return 0;
}
